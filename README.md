## Introduction

This report analyzes a dataset of movie ratings and answers various questions related to movie popularity, age, gender differences, family background, and more. We use statistical tests with a significance level ùõº set to 0.005 for each test, as per Benjamin et al., 2018.

## Question 1: Movie Popularity and Ratings

To answer whether more popular movies have higher ratings, we perform a median split on popularity to distinguish high vs. low popularity movies and then conduct a t-test.

## Question 2: Movie Age and Ratings

To investigate if newer movies are rated differently from older movies, we perform a median split on the year of release and conduct a t-test.

## Question 3: Gendered Enjoyment of 'Shrek (2001)'

We assess if male and female viewers rate 'Shrek (2001)' differently using a t-test.

## Question 4: Proportion of Movies Rated Differently by Gender

## Question 6: Proportion of Movies with an "Only Child Effect"

## Question 7: Enjoyment of 'The Wolf of Wall Street (2013)' Based on Social Watching

We assess if people who like to watch movies socially enjoy 'The Wolf of Wall Street (2013)' more than those who prefer to watch alone using a t-test.

## Question 8: Proportion of Movies with a "Social Watching" Effect
